iCurriculum is an open-source educational app for homeschoolers and teachers.
## Features
Current features include:


* Interactive video playlist


... and many more coming up!


## Purpose
You know those educational TV shows, you know, the ones that try to teach a kid one subject, like a school-aged kid but they ignore it because it is too 'babyish'? Well, iCurriculum is the solution to that! The videos in each age group are found and made for that group only. Example: If a school-aged kid sees a 2-4 yr. old video they'll think it's 'babyish' and mark iCurriculum as a negative experience. So, make sure a kid sees only the videos that are in there age group.


## My Dream With This
I want this app to be a resource that will be used for generations to come. So, your contributions help alot, but if you want to contribute email me at schoolonandroid@outlook.com.
